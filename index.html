                       Business History 
                    </h1>
                    <p>Boy Ronda Petshop came to life during one of the most challenging times, the COVID-19 pandemic. It all started as a humble endeavor, with us traveling to places like Pampanga, Laguna, and Bicol to gather fish and aquarium supplies and sell them in Metro Manila. With strict lockdowns in place, moving around was tough, but we got creative. Thanks to a family friend who was a nurse, we were able to hitch rides to keep the business going, even when it felt impossible.

                        As the situation improved and restrictions eased, my two brothers and I took things into our own hands, literally. We hopped on our motorcycles and rode to suppliers ourselves, ensuring we could bring back the best products for our growing customer base. It was those trips that inspired the name "Boy Ronda" — symbolizing our rounds across the country, always on the move to find the best for our customers.
                        
                        We started small, running the business from our own home, where it gradually took over half of the house. As more people began coming to us, we realized we needed to expand, and that's when we decided to move into a commercial space.
                        
                        My brother, John Paolo, made a huge leap when he left his stable 9-to-5 job, one he had for five years, to join me in making Boy Ronda a full-time endeavor. His courage and our combined efforts have helped us turn this small dream into a thriving business, now bringing in anywhere between 20,000 and 50,000 pesos each day. Looking back, it's been an incredible journey of grit, teamwork, and a shared passion for what we do.</p>

            <h2 class="history-title">University of Manila History</h2>
           
            <div class="umhistory-content scrollable-container">
                <p>On October 5, 1913, a group of four young men and a woman, with ages from fifteen to twenty-one met for breakfast at the Palma de Mallorca, a popular restaurant beside the Sto. Domingo Church in Intramuros, Manila.</p>
    
                <p>The five were Dr. Apolinario G. de los Santos, his brother, Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos, his sister, Maria de los Santos, and two friends Dr. Buenaventura J. Bello and Atty. Antonio Rivero. They were only college students then, who were more daring than their contemporaries for they were determined to pursue their dream of putting up a school suited to the needs of the Filipino youth.</p>
    
                <p>These impecunious young people, as they were called by the university historian, encountered many challenges in realizing their dream of establishing an institution whose motto was “Patria, Scientia, et Virtus. They named their school Instituto de Manila, after the city of their affection and Apolinario de los Santos was elected as the first director of the school.</p>
    
                <p>The doors of the Instituto de Manila were first opened in school year 1914-1915. The forerunner of this institution offered only elementary and high school courses in a leased building located at the corner of Madrid and Peñarubia streets, Binondo District. However, in school year 1919-1920, in order to accommodate its growing populace and to provide them with better facilities, the Instituto de Manila started conducting classes in its own building at the Sampaloc District.</p>
    
                <p>Before embarking on a program of expansion in order to meet the educational needs of its constituency, the Instituto de Manila had to undergo internal changes. On the occasion of its eighth anniversary, the original incorporators unanimously agreed to effect a reorganization geared towards the attainment of a university status. As a result, the Instituto de Manila was re-incorporated as the University of Manila on November 3, 1921 under the provisions of Act No. 1459 of the former Philippine Legislature.</p>
    
                <p>Right after its re-incorporation, the University focused on providing more course offerings for their growing clientele. The growth and expansion marked the turning point of this democratic and dynamic institution which has withstood the test of time. The University has survived two world wars and the bewildering changes in the country and of the world: ideological, social, economic, and political.</p>
    
                <p>The mustard seed that was the University of Manila continues to show impressive growth and expansion. In March 1919, the College of Law was formally opened. In the following year, 1920, the College of Liberal Arts was also opened. In 1922-1923, three colleges: College of Philosophy and Letters, College of Education, and College of Business Administration were opened while the Department of Graduate Studies was opened in 1941. In December, 1945, the College of Engineering was opened and in the following year, 1946, the Academy of Music and the School of Foreign Service were born.</p>
    
                <p>The College of Law was given government recognition on November 1, 1920. It was formally incorporated into the University during the academic year 1921-1922. Barely, after two years of its founding, the College of Law caught public attention and gained popular acclaim when two of its graduates: Pablo Payawal, who later became a prominent law practitioner, and Jose Carlos, who became a judge, copped the first and second places, respectively, in the 1920 Bar Examinations.</p>
    
                <p>Three years later, former Civil Service Commissioner Amado Del Rosario and Cipriano Primicias who became a majority floor leader in the defunct Senate and who was one of the vice-presidential nominees for the 1961 national elections, followed suit by garnering the second and sixth places, respectively, in the 1922 Bar Examinations. And during the three years that followed, the graduates of the College easily hurdled the Bar with 100 percent passing average. This achievement of the College was so impressive that the pre-war Tribune and Philippine Herald newspapers were all praises for the University of Manila.</p>
    
                <p>In 1933, Lope Quimbo, Manuel Alvero, and Guillermo Blanco became the first, second, and tenth placers in the Bar Examinations respectively. In 1936, the College again produced another batch of topnotchers where Teodorico Martin was the sixth placer who became the Dean of the College of Law of the University of the East. Again, in 1937, Sixto Domondon copped the tenth place in the Bar Examinations. To continue, in 1938, Emmanuel Pelaez, who was to become Vice-President of the Philippines, led that year’s Bar Examinations “elite” by copping the first place. With Emmanuel Pelaez there were also two topnotchers, namely Rodegelio Jalandoni, sixth placer, and Pedro Bacerro, the seventh placer in the Bar Examinations. In 1940, the College again showed its impressive performance by having Delfin De Vera garnering the fourth place in the Bar.</p>
    
                <p>During the post-war years, the College of Law reasserted its Bar supremacy by producing topnotchers. In 1948, Jose M. Evangelista, who was to become ambassador, placed second and established a record high rating of 95.04 percent. Moreover, this feat was duplicated in 1949 by Dominador R. Aytona who also captured the second place. Aytona became a vice-presidential nominee in 1961 under the Nacionalista Party banner. Two years later, in 1951, Vicente Acsay kept up the excellent performance of the College by notching the first place in the Bar Examinations. The good showing of the College continued, for in 1953, Leonardo Amores, who was to become the illustrious faculty member of the College hit the same spot with the highest rating of 95.03 percent.</p>
    
                <p>Up to the present year, the College of Law graduates fared exceedingly well in the bar examinations with ratings above the national passing percentage. In 2006, the College of Law graduates obtained a 75 percent passing in the Bar Examinations, again proving the quality of education being sustained throughout the years by the University of Manila.</p>
    
                <p>To show the march to progress of the University, in 1949, courses were offered in Master of Arts in Political Science in the Department of Graduate Studies, followed by the opening of Master of Arts in History and Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education in 1951. Then, from 1963 to 1966, courses in the College of Criminology and Penology, the School of Secretarial Science and the master’s degree in Public Administration were offered. On June 7, 1976, the following two-year courses were offered— in Police Science and Technology, in Library Science, and in Bookkeeping; one-year course in Hotel and Restaurant Management and one-year course in Tourism.</p>
    
                <p>The sustainable growth and expansion of the University were the products of the highly innovative, creative, and brilliant minds of those who occupied the presidency. Dr. Apolinario de los Santos was the University President from its inception until 1927. His successor was Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos, who assumed the presidency at the age of 29, and it is a matter of record and source of pardonable pride that he held the distinction of being the youngest university president in the Philippines, in Asia, and in the whole world. Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos co-founded the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU) and was elected as its President from 1938 to 1939 and from 1955 to 1958. He also co-founded the United Nations Association of the Philippines. Moreover, he is the adviser on educational matters to six Philippine Presidents: Manuel L. Quezon, Jose P. Laurel, Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Ramon Magsaysay and Carlos P. Garcia. He was president of the University until his untimely demise on October 13, 1959.</p>
    
                <p>The unfinished task of leading the University was continued by Madame Helen de los Santos, who was described by the late Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos in his book, “Education and Life” as his life partner “who has shared with me all the tribulations of life but cared little for its vainglories.” One of the pioneers in education and a compleat Filipino woman, Madame Helen de los Santos’ vision was to improve the University’s programs of study. Her policy was to bequeath to future generations a university that, while still adhering to its mission, was always attuned to the rapidly changing needs of the times.</p>
    
                <p>In 1958, the College of Law became the University’s flagship program and attracted more students both local and international. Under the stewardship of the University’s fourth president, Dr. Juan S. de los Santos, who took the helm in 1959 until 1967, the college built a new building, an addition to the old one, to house its growing clientele. He also focused on improving the facilities and expanding the academic programs of the University. In 1967, Dr. Juan S. de los Santos relinquished the presidency to Dr. Roberto de la Cruz, who was then a professor and the Dean of the College of Law. Dr. Roberto de la Cruz continued to improve the facilities of the University and its academic programs until he passed away in 1978.</p>
    
                <p>In the same year, the presidency of the University was assumed by Dr. Alfredo B. Aguilar.
